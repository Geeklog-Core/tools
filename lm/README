lm.php v0.6

These little scripts merge a Geeklog (foreign) language file with the
english.php language file, so that new strings added to english.php are
automatically added to the other language file as well.

Usage:

    lm.php langfile.php > new-langfile.php

mblm.php does the same but for UTF-8 language files. It requires a PHP version
with multi-byte string support built in (--enable-mbstring option). Otherwise,
it works exactly like lm.php.

These scripts, while written in PHP, are supposed to be run from the command
line and thus require the CLI version of PHP to be installed on your
computer. They also display the merged language file on the screen, so you
should redirect the output to a new file. They also expects to find the
english.php language file in the current directory.

What they can do:

- add new individual strings and string arrays to the language file
- do some pretty printing

What they can not do:

- remove obsoleted strings
- detect changed strings

Since we don't usually remove obsoleted strings from Geeklog (in the hope
that they can be reused at a later date), the first issue shouldn't be a
problem.

For changes in existing strings, it is recommended that you subscribe to
the geeklog-translations mailing list, where such information will be posted
when a new version of Geeklog is about to be released.

lm.php was originally written for Geeklog 1.3.9. It should work just fine
with language files from older versions, though.
