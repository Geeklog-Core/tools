mkdist.sh is the script I use to create the "official" Geeklog tarballs. It
requires the following directory structure:

    ./mkdist.sh                 -- the script
    ./Geeklog-1.x/              -- the local copy of the CVS repository
    ./dist/                     -- directory of previous releases
    ./pear/pear-1.3/            -- the PEAR classes to use live here, e.g.
                   /Archive/
                   /System.php
                   ...
                   /XML/

To create a tarball for Geeklog 1.4.17sr3 when the previous version was
1.4.17sr2, you'd call the script like so:

    ./mkdist.sh 1.4.17sr3 1.4.17sr2

which will create a tarball

    ./dist/geeklog-1.4.17sr3.tar.gz

The tarball will include the PEAR classes and a list of the files that changed
over the previous version. The script will also print the md5 checksum of the
tarball it just created.

The script also has an option to build a German release - from files that
currently only live on my local hard drive ...
