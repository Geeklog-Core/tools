mkdist.sh is the script I use to create the "official" Geeklog tarballs. It
requires the following directory structure:

    ./mkdist.sh                 -- the script
    ./geeklog/geeklog/          -- the local copy of the Mercurial repository
    ./dist/                     -- directory of previous releases
    ./pear/pear-1.3/            -- the PEAR classes to use live here, e.g.
                   /Archive/
                   /System.php
                   ...
                   /XML/

To create a tarball for Geeklog 1.4.17sr3 when the previous version was
1.4.17sr2, you'd call the script like so:

    ./mkdist.sh 1.4.17sr3 1.4.17sr2

which will create a tarball

    ./dist/geeklog-1.4.17sr3.tar.gz

The tarball will include the PEAR classes and a list of the files that changed
over the previous version. The script will also print the md5 checksum of the
tarball it just created.

There's a third (optional) argument: The name of the directory to pack. That
directory has to be below the "geeklog" directory and defaults to "geeklog"
(hence the ./geeklog/geeklog/ above). To create a tarball from a repository
in ./geeklog/bugfix, use

    ./mkdist.sh 1.4.17sr3 1.4.17sr2 bugfix
